<h3>Discover your skills and careers</h3>

<p>
    This assessment asks you to think about the type of work you want to do. It takes 5 to 10 minutes, or slightly longer if you’re using a screen reader or magnifier.
</p>

<p>
    At the end, you’ll get a summary of job groups that might interest you based on your answers, for example creative careers or working in healthcare.
</p>

<p>
    You can answer a few more questions to see particular jobs that may suit you, like an animator or a paramedic. From here, you can get more detailed information about each role.
</p>

<p>
    You can save your results and come back to them at any time.
